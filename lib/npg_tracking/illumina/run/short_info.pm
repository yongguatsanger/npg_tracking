=head1 NAME

npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info

=head1 VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Mypackage;
  use Moose;
  with q{npg_tracking::illumina::run::short_info};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Moose role ties together three attributes, id_run, name and run_folder,
which are central to tracking Illumina sequencing runs at the institute and
processing sequencing data.

The ability to infer two of these values given a third one relies on run folder
name following a certain string pattern. If access to a run tracking database
is available and the database contains relevant records, any non-empty string
can be used as a run folder name. Access to a run tracking database is made via
the npg_tracking_schema attribute, which can be provided by a class which
consumes this role.

See npg_tracking::illumina::run::folder for an example implementation of the
npg_tracking_schema attribute.

If your class consumes this role, you need either to provide the run_folder
attribute value on construction or implement a _build_run_folder method in your
class. Failure to do this WILL cause a run-time error along the lines of

  Mypackage does not support builder method '_build_run_folder' for attribute 'run_folder'

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 id_run

An attribute, can be set in the constructor or lazy-built assuming that the
run_folder attribute value is available or can be built.

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new(id_run => $id_run);
  my $iIdRun = $oPackage->id_run();

=head2 name

An attribute, can be set in the constructor. It can also be lazy-built assuming
that id_run or run_folder was provided attribute value is available.
The ability to build this attribute without database support is not guaranteed.

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new(name => $name);
  my $sName = $oPackage->name();

=head2 run_folder

An attribute, can be set in the constructor or lazy-built. A class consuming
this role should provide a _build_run_folder method. Failure to provide a builder
will cause a run-time error. Constrained to not contain file-system path -
anything which looks like such a path will be coerced to the last component of the path.

  my $oPackage = Mypackage->new(run_folder => $run_folder);
  my $sRunFolder = $oPackage->run_folder();

=head2 short_reference

A method. Returns the first it finds from run_folder, id_run, name.

  my $ShortReference = $oPackage->short_reference();

No guarantee that this method is going to be supported in future releases.
Deriving classes should not use it.

=head2 instrument_string

An attribute, the name of the instrument, will be lazy-built,
usually no need to set it via a constructor.

  my $sInstrumentString = $oPackage->instrument_string();

=head2 slot

An attribute, the name of the instrument slot, will be lazy-built,
usually no need to set it via a constructor.

  my $slot = $oPackage->slot();

=head2 flowcell_id

An attribute, will be lazy-built, usually no need to set it
via a constructor.
If the machine is a HiSeq, the flowcell id that was used.
If the machine is a MiSeq, the reagent kit id that was used.

  my $fid = $oPackage->flowcell_id();
