  package main;
  use my::package;
  
  my $p = my::package->new(attr_a => 'a', attr_b => 2);
  my json = $p->freeze();
  print $json; # prints {"attr_a":"a","attr_b":2}

  my $p1 = my::package->thaw($json);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<npg_tracking::glossary::composition> objects and component objects
that make up a composition use the L<MooseX::Storage> serialization
framework to enable serialization to (freeze) and from (thaw) JSON
strings. This Moose role provides custom JSON serialization format
for MooseX::Storage framework by implementing custom C<freeze> and
C<thaw> methods. The role also provides other custom serialization
formats, which are used by NPG pipelines and other applications.

=head2 Serialization to JSON

Differences with L<MooseX::Storage::Format::JSON>:

=over

=item Uses JSON::XS.

=item Produces canonical (sorted) JSON strings.

=item Private attributes are not serialized.

=item The C<__CLASS__> key is not serialized.

=item The above applies recursively to members of an array reference
      attribute called C<components>, which can contain objects of any
      class as long as these classes consume the
      L<npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component> role.

=back

=head2 Serialization to an rtp string.

A lossy conversion to a concise text string, which can be used as a
convenient human-readable id in web applications and command line arguments.
This type of serialization is specific to the
L<npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina> class. It
disregards the value of the C<subset> attribute of the object. See
L<npg_tracking::glossary::rpt> for details.

=head2 Serialization to unique 64- or 32-long character strings

This is a one-way serialization that is possible for any type of the
component. It produces fixed length strings that are unique to a particular
component or composition object and are guaranteed not to clash. The
computation of the string is deterministic. These strings are widely used
in NPG applications as unique identifiers for pipelines' inputs and outputs
and as the common part of files names in cases of complex provenance of
the files, see L<npg_tracking::glossary::moniker> for details.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 thaw

Instantiates an object from a JSON string.

  my $c = my::package->thaw($json);

If the JSON string does not contain class names of some or all components,
the default thaw method fails. The component class to use where it's
missing can be supplied.

  my $c = my::package->thaw(
    $json,
    component_class => 'npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina');

If the enforce_component_class option is set to true, an error is reaised
if the class of any of the components is defined and is different from the
supplied component class.

  my $c = my::package->thaw(
    $json,
    enforce_component_class => 1,
    component_class => 'npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina');

=head2 freeze

Serializes object's public attributes to a canonical (ordered) JSON string.

  $p->freeze();

Example output:

  {"components":[{"id_run":27081,"position":1,"subset":"phix","tag_index":0}]}

This string does not contain class names of the components and, therefore,
cannot be deserialized without additional options passed to the thaw method.
For a more conventional serialization set with_class_names to a true value.

 $p->freeze(with_class_names => 1);

Example output:

 {"__CLASS__":"npg_tracking::glossary::composition","components":[{"__CLASS__":"npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina","id_run":27081,"position":1,"subset":"phix","tag_index":0}]}

=head2 freeze2rpt

Returns a serialization of the object to an rpt string representation.
If the object has 'components' attribute/method that returns a true value,
this value is serialized instead. It is expected that the objects that
are serialized satisfy the minimum requirements of the
npg_tracking::glossary::rpt->deflate_rpt method, otherwise this method
gives an error. See npg_tracking::glossary::rpt for details.

  $p->freeze2rpt();

=head2 digest

Returns a digest of the JSON serialization string for $self.

  $p->digest();      # sha256_hex digest
  $p->digest('md5'); # md5 digest

=head2 compute_digest

Returns a digest of an input string.

  $p->compute_digest($string);        # sha256_hex digest
  $p->compute_digest($string, 'md5'); # md5 digest
