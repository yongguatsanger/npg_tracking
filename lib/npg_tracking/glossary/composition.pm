A class that uses its own attributes to build the composition,
see npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory::attributes for details.

  package my::package;
  use Moose;
  use namespace::autoclean;
  with 'npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory::attributes' =>
    => { component_class => 'my::component' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A base class for a collection of one or more entities (components).
See npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component for a generic component
interface and npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component::illumina
for Illumina sequencing specific implementation.

See npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory and roles in
npg_tracking::glossary::composition::factory::* for factory methods to
generate the composition object.

A file with sequencing data can contain reads obtained in a single
sequencing run or in a number of runs. The composition describes the origin
of the data via components. The component binds together necessary and
sufficient metadata belonging to data originating from a single experiment
on a sample or library.

For example, for Illumina sequencing, data for a particular sample, which are
obtained in a single sequencing experiment, are inambiquously defined by run
or flowcell id, flowcell position and tag sequence or tag index. A sample
or library can be sequenced a number of times in different runs. 

Attempt Run_Id Lane_Id Tag_Index
1         3       2        56
2         7       7        56
3         9       1        56

The data then can be merged together into a single file. For auditing
purposes it is important to know the origin of the data, which is
given by a composition of three components, 3-2-56, 7-7-56 and 9-1-56,
a triplet per component.

Where the data originates from a single run, is can be described
by a composition containing a single component. Thus the data from attempt
1 in the above example are described by a one-componet composition 3-2-56.   

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 BUILD

An extension for the constructor method. Checks that the composition is
not empty (error for an empty composition) and sorts the composition
thus ensuring that the order the components were given to the composition
factory does not matter.

=head2 components_list

Returns a list of component objects.
  
  my @list = $composition->components_list();

=head2 num_components

Returns number of components.

  print 'Number of components ' . $composition->num_components();

=head2 get_component

Returns a component at index.

  my $component = $composition->get_component(2);

=head2 find

Finds and returns a component that is equal to the argument component.
The comparison is based on the compare_serialized method of the
npg_tracking::glossary::composition::component object.

  my $found = $composition->find($component);

Undefined value is returned if nothing was found.

=head2 freeze

Returns a custom canonical (sorted) JSON serialization of the object.

Guaranteed to be the same for a set of immutable components regardless
of the order the componets were added to the composition. Inherited
from npg_tracking::glossary::composition::serializable.

  $composition->freeze();

=head2 freeze2rpt

Returns a serialization of the object to a string representation of
the rpt list. Components should at least implement id_run and
position methods/attributes, otherwise this method gives an error.
See npg_tracking::glossary::rpt.

Guaranteed to be the same for a set of components regardless of the
order the componets were added to the composition. Inherited from
npg_tracking::glossary::composition::serializable.

  $composition->freeze2rpt();

If the composition is empty, and empty string is returned.

=head2 thaw

Given a JSON string representing an object, returns an instance of the
object.

  my $composition = npg_tracking::glossary::composition->thaw($json_string);

=head2 digest

Computes a unique signature for the composition as defined by the
digest method in npg_tracking::glossary::composition::serializable.
Guaranteed to be the same for a set of immutable components regardless
of the order the componets were added to the composition.

  $composition->digest();      # sha256_hex digest
  $composition->digest('md5'); # md5 digest
